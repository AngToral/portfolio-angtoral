        "dev-desc3": "On the front end, I started with Expenses, as it is the core of the website. Having administrative and HR knowledge, I knew exactly what I needed to capture, and how. So I didn't skimp on filters, and I wanted the information to be user-friendly.",
        "dev-desc4": "Here my challenges were to make -populate- to a lot of functions , to show the expense and related trip information, use the Context to filter employee or HR information, create the emails that are sent when approving expenses (two types of emails, depending on whether the expense is personal or with company credit card), and the part of uploading the receipts in the end was developed by one of my colleagues, since due to time I couldn't dedicate more to making it happen myself.",
        "dev-desc5": "The Travel part was easier and shorter to develop, since it wasn't the main character."
